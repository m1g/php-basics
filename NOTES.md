# Classes

A class is a definition or description that defines two things **Properties** and **Methods** and it describes an **Object**.

Properties contain variables, arrays, and data whereas methods describe functions/behaviors

An example object is a **Car** :

* Properties
  * Wheels
  * Seats
  * Radio

* Methods
  * Move Wheels
  * Move Seats
  * Turn on Radio


# Constructors

A constructor is called by classes so it is suitable for any initialization that the object may need before it is used. I.e., validations and ensuring data is present
